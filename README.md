i spent way too long trying to figure out how to retrigger the animation   
from js.    

i wanted to have css variables (--current-color, --new-color)   
and restart the animation, but fading from the new --current-color   
to the new --new-color.    

i had to give up.   

so if you wonder why i have all this extra stuff in the app.js,   
that's why.     

i left it at least changing the sky color.
